# Solidity
- solidity allows us to create our own structures using 'struct Item {} layout'
- solidity is a statically typed language
- uint = unsigned integer (means it cannot be negative)
- mapping in solidity is like an associative array or a hash where you store key/value pairs (kind of like a database)
-allows us to create events any time something occurs inside the smart contract, and consumers can subscribe to these events and be alerted any time something changes

# Truffle Contract
- is a javascript representation of the smart contract
